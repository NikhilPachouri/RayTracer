# RayTracer
This rayTracer is fully based on c++,currently i am not using any sort of 
graphics api thats why its just a frame picture wise,but as i complete this 
i will think of implementing it with a graphics api like vulkan or opengl so
that i can create something that can raytrace in real time.

till now i have learned how the raytracer is rendering a single object but now i am going to go through the process of projecting multiple objects into the scene.
